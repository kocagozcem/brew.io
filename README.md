# brew.io

Brew.io is an React Native project which is i create for improve myself. I'm trying to work on it on my free times. I'm in the initial stages of the project so i hope everything gonna be better than that (especially UI)

## What is brew.io

Brew.io is a coffee recipes application. It will contain recipes and some criterions about the recipe (like intensity, cost, attainibility). Probably I'm not gonna create an database and backend services because i just trying to create a completed React Native application.

## Goals

- Complete application (ofc)
- Write tests
- Create an eye-pleasing UI
